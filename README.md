#E-commerce-website-THE-REVIVED-GOODS-
THE REVIVED GOODS is a front-end marketplace application built entirely with Vanilla JavaScript, designed to promote the reuse and exchange of second-hand goods. The platform enables users to browse listings of items that can be bought, sold, or donated, making it both functional and socially impactful. By implementing features such as advanced filters, sorting, and persistent state management, this project demonstrates my ability to design and develop interactive applications with clean and logical architecture.

The core of the application revolves around product listings that users can filter by category, condition, price range, or keyword search. Sorting options such as “price low-to-high,” “price high-to-low,” and “newest” give users flexibility in how they explore available items. To improve user experience, filters are displayed in real time as active chips, and changes are applied seamlessly without requiring page reloads. This reflects a strong understanding of DOM manipulation and efficient rendering.

Beyond browsing, users can engage with products by adding them to their cart or wishlist. The cart includes options for saving items for later, while the wishlist offers a simple way to track favorite products. Both features are fully persistent through the use of localStorage, ensuring that user preferences are remembered across sessions. This persistence demonstrates my skills in client-side state management without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

A standout feature of the platform is the Sell and Donate functionality. Users can contribute their own items to the marketplace by filling out interactive forms, which then generate new product listings. Donations are automatically marked as free items, while “sell” items are assigned a price. These user-generated listings are saved alongside the default sample items, showcasing the app’s ability to dynamically expand its dataset and remain extensible for real-world use cases.

From a design perspective, the application includes toast notifications, drawer panels, and modal forms to deliver a modern, user-friendly interface. Interactive touches like quick status updates, active filter displays, and smooth state transitions elevate the user experience. Accessibility considerations such as meaningful button labels and a clean, responsive layout are also part of the design direction, making the app inclusive and usable across devices.

This project was a valuable exercise in building a complete product experience without relying on frameworks, focusing instead on strong core skills: JavaScript ES6 features, event-driven programming, DOM manipulation, and client-side persistence. It highlights not only technical ability but also attention to user experience, maintainability, and scalability. Future improvements could include implementing backend APIs for multi-user functionality, replacing alert pop-ups with detail modals, and adding pagination or infinite scrolling for larger datasets.
